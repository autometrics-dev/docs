# Deploying Prometheus in Kubernetes

Prometheus is the most popular open-source monitoring solution for Kubernetes, therefore deploying and configuring it is pretty straightforward.

Prometheus supports service discovery, so it can automatically find Kubernetes
pods to scrape.

## Requirements

- Kubernetes cluster running with `kubectl` configured to access it
- Make sure you have [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install) installed


## Instructions

<Steps>

### Create a `monitoring` namespace

It is a good practice to keep all monitoring resources in a separate namespace.

```bash
kubectl create namespace monitoring
```

### Deploy Prometheus to Kubernetes


Run the following command to install Prometheus using the Helm chart:

```bash
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --namespace monitoring
```

This will install Prometheus in your cluster along with Alertmanager, Node Exporter, and a few other components.


### Make Autometrics discoverable

If you have installed Prometheus using the [helm chart](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts), service discovery should be enabled by default.

Service discovery uses Kubernetes annotations to tell Prometheus which ports to look for. In order to make sure that your application metrics are available add the following annotations to your app's deployment:

```yaml filename="deployment.yaml"
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
        prometheus.io/path: "/metrics"
        prometheus.io/port: "9464" # this can be different depending on which library you have used for instrumentation
```

### (Optional) Add Autometrics ruleset to Prometheus

If you want to make use of the SLO alerting features in Autometrics, you need to add the Autometrics alerting rules to your Prometheus instance.

You can find the ruleset in the [Autometrics repository](https://github.com/autometrics-dev/autometrics-shared/blob/main/autometrics.rules.yml).

#### Save the ruleset to a file

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/autometrics-dev/autometrics-shared/main/autometrics.rules.yml > autometrics.rules.yml
```

#### Create a ConfigMap from the ruleset

```bash
kubectl create configmap autometrics-rules --from-file=autometrics.rules.yml --namespace monitoring
```

#### Create a `values.yaml` file for the Prometheus Helm chart

The `values.yaml` file is used to add extra configuration to the Prometheus Helm chart. In this case we will mount the extra configuration as a ConfigMap and modify Prometheus configuration to include the Autometrics ruleset.

```yaml filename="values.yaml"
server:
  extraConfigmapMounts:
    - name: autometrics-rules
      mountPath: /autometrics-alerts/
      configMap: autometrics-rules
      readOnly: true
serverFiles:
  prometheus.yml:
    rule_files:
      - /etc/config/recording_rules.yml # leave whichever rules you have already
      - /etc/config/alerting_rules.yml #
      - /autometrics-alerts/autometrics.rules.yml # <- add the autometrics ruleset here
```

#### Upgrade Prometheus using Helm

Upgrade the Prometheus installation using the `helm upgrade` command, passing in the `values.yaml` file.

```bash
helm upgrade prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --namespace monitoring -f values.yaml
```
