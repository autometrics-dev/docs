# Deploying Prometheus in Kubernetes

Prometheus supports service discovery, so it can automatically find Kubernetes
pods to scrape.

If you have Prometheus installed using the [helm
chart](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts), service discovery
should be enabled by default.

Add the following annotations to your app's deployment:

```yaml filename="deployment.yaml"
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
        prometheus.io/path: "/metrics"
        prometheus.io/port: "9091"
```
