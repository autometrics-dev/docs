# Configuring Prometheus on Fly.io

[Fly.io](https://fly.io) provides a hosted Prometheus instance for every
project.

To have Fly's Prometheus scrape your Autometrics-instrumented app, simply add
this to your [`fly.toml` configuration](https://fly.io/docs/reference/configuration/#the-metrics-section):

```toml filename="fly.toml"
app = "your-app-name"

[metrics]
port = 9091 # default for most prometheus clients
path = "/metrics" # default for most prometheus clients
```
