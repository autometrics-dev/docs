# Deploying Prometheus with Docker

Prometheus can be easily deployed using Docker - official images are provided on Docker Hub.

### Requirements

Make sure you have Docker running on the system.

<Steps>

### Create a configuration file

Create a file called `prometheus.yml` with the following contents:

```yaml {filename="prometheus.yml"} showLineNumbers
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: my-app-name
    metrics_path: /metrics
    static_configs:
      # Replace the port with the port your /metrics endpoint is running on
      - targets: ["localhost:3000"]
    scrape_interval: 15s
```

See the [Prometheus configuration reference](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/) for full details.

### Run Prometheus

You can now run Prometheus with the configuration file you created:

```bash
docker run \
 -p 9090:9090 \
 -v prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
 prom/prometheus
```

### (Production) Create persistent volumes

If you're deploying Prometheus to production using Docker, it is a good practice to create a named persistent volume where Prometheus would store the data. This will ensure your metrics data persists even in case the container shuts down.

To create the volume run the `docker volume create <VOLUME_NAME>` command:

```bash
docker volume create prometheus-data
```

And when starting up the Prometheus container make sure to tell Prometheus to use our `prometheus-data` volume:

```bash
docker run \
 -p 9090:9090 \
 -v prometheus-data:/prometheus \
 -v prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
 prom/prometheus
```


### Verify successful startup

Your Prometheus should now be accessible on `<your_network_host>:9090`!

</Steps>
