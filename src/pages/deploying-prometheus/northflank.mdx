# Deploying Prometheus on Northflank

Prometheus is available as an official Docker image on Docker Hub. We can use it as a base image and layer in our configuration before deploying it on Northflank.

<Steps>

### Create a GitHub repository and a Prometheus configuration file
We will use Northflank's ability to deploy from a repository using a [Dockerfile](https://northflank.com/docs/v1/application/build/build-with-a-dockerfile) to set up our Prometheus instance.

Create a file called `prometheus.yml` with the following contents:

```yaml {filename="prometheus.yml"} showLineNumbers
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: my-app-name
    metrics_path: /metrics
    static_configs:
      # Replace the port with the port your /metrics endpoint is running on
      - targets: ["your-app-on-northflank:3000"]
    scrape_interval: 15s
```

See the [Prometheus configuration reference](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/) for full details.

### Add a Dockerfile in the root of the repository

The below Dockerfile uses the base Prometheus image, loads our configuration, makes the 9090 port available, and runs the container as a `root` user in Docker to make sure it can access the persistent volume properly.

```Dockerfile
FROM prom/prometheus:latest

ADD prometheus.yml /etc/prometheus/

EXPOSE 9090

USER root
```

### Create a Northflank service from a GitHub repo

Create a Northflank service from our newly created GitHub repo, it should pick up the configuration from the Dockerfile 

### Add Network configurations

In order to make Prometheus accessible to other services in your Northflank network or externally configure the PORT & DNS settings under the service network section in the Northflank UI.
If you want to connect it to the Autometrics Explorer ensure to set the `Port` to 9090 and choose TCP as `Protocol`.
