# Configuring Prometheus locally (for testing)

Once you have your code instrumented with autometrics, you'll need to run
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) and point it at your app.

Prometheus is pull-based, meaning it will poll your app to scrape the metrics
collected.

<Steps>
### Download and install Prometheus

<Tabs items={['Homebrew (macOS)', 'Docker', 'Pre-compiled binary']}>
<Tab>
```bash copy
brew install prometheus
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```bash copy
docker pull prom/prometheus
```
</Tab>

You can download the latest release from the [Prometheus website](https://prometheus.io/download/).

### Create a configuration file

Create a file called `prometheus.yml` with the following contents:

```yaml {filename="prometheus.yml"} copy showLineNumbers
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: my-app
    metrics_path: /metrics
    static_configs:
      # Replace the port with the port your /metrics endpoint is running on
      - targets: ['localhost:3000']
    # For a real deployment, you would want the scrape interval to be
    # longer but for testing, you want the data to show up quickly
    scrape_interval: 200ms
```

### Run Prometheus

You can now run Prometheus with the configuration file you created:

```bash copy
prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
```

Or with Docker:

```bash copy
docker run \
 -p 9090:9090 \
 -v prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
 prom/prometheus
```


</Steps>
