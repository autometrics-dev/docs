# Local development

Autometrics CLI enables a proper local workflow for developer metrics. You can add, test, and see the immediate effect of adding metrics to your functions in the Explorer UI. Your changes now won't require a full cycle of *change-commit-deploy-to-dev* to see if it shows up as you intended in your monitoring dashboard.

### Why locally?

- **Iterate faster**. Add, change, and validate metrics locally without having to commit and deploy to dev.
- **Collaborate easier**. Anyone on the team can experiment and share learnings from metrics without lengthy setup.

## How it works

Autometrics CLI is a simple utility that wraps a Prometheus server and includes the Explorer web interface that helps you see all of your Autometrics-instrumented functions and the metrics they generate.

When you run `am start <METRICS_ENDPOINTS>` in your terminal, the CLI will check if you have an available Prometheus binary on your computer. If not, it will download the latest version of Prometheus and start it on the port you specified.

It will also start a web server (by default on `localhost:6789`) with the Autometrics Explorer in which you can explore your instrumented functions and see the metrics they generate.

**A quick note on how Prometheus works:**

Prometheus is a popular open-source monitoring solution that is used by many companies to collect metrics from their applications. It is a [**pull-based** system](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/faq/#why-do-you-pull-rather-than-push), meaning that it periodically polls the metrics endpoints of your applications to collect the metrics.

Therefore, you have to pass in the endpoints when running `am start` as arguments - Prometheus needs to know where to look for the data.

## Getting started with `am`

<Steps>

### Install the CLI

You can install the CLI using Homebrew or by downloading the binary directly.

<Tabs items={["macOS", "Linux"]}>
    <Tab>
        ```shell filename="shell"
        brew install autometrics-dev/tap/am
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```shell filename="arm64"
        curl -L https://github.com/autometrics-dev/am/releases/latest/download/am-linux-aarch64 -o am
        # make it executable with chmod
        chmod u+x am
        ```
        ```shell filename="x86_64"
        curl -L https://github.com/autometrics-dev/am/releases/latest/download/am-linux-x86_64 -o am
        # make it executable with chmod
        chmod u+x am
        ```
    </Tab>

</Tabs>


### Start Prometheus and Explorer UI

You can then start the Prometheus server and Explorer by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell filename="$ shell"
./am start <METRICS_ENDPOINTS>
```
`<METRICS_ENDPOINTS>` - one or more port number + URL path combinations that expose metrics in the Prometheus format. The format you express your endpoint is quite flexible so any of the following will work:

| `METRICS_ENDPOINT` | Resolved URL |
| -------- | --- |
| `am start :3000` | http://localhost:3000/metrics |
| `am start 127.0.0.1` | http://127.0.0.1:80/metrics |
| `am start https://127.0.0.1` | https://127.0.0.1:443/metrics |
| `am start localhost:3030` | http://localhost:3030/metrics |
| `am start localhost:3030/api/metrics` | http://localhost:3030/api/metrics |
| `am start localhost:3030/api/observability` | http://localhost:3030/api/observability |




### Go to the Explorer

You can now navigate to http://localhost:6789 to see the Explorer. You can also see the Prometheus at http://localhost:9090.

</Steps>


## Configuration

`am` can be configured for each of your projects. In your project repository you
can add a `am.toml` configuration file wherein you can define defaults when
using `am start`.

### Example

The following example shows all the different configuration items. This will
start a pushgateway and adds two endpoints for Prometheus to sample the metrics
from:

```toml filename="am.toml"
pushgateway-enabled = true
prometheus-scrape-interval = "1m"

[[endpoint]]
job-name = "main_app"
url = "http://localhost:3030"
prometheus-scrape-interval = "5s"

[[endpoint]]
job-name = "another_app"
url = "http://localhost:9090"
```

### Configuration reference

This section describes all the configuration items that can be used in the
`am.toml` file.

| Item | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `pushgateway-enabled` | `boolean` | Whether to enable the Pushgateway |
| `prometheus-scrape-interval` | `string` | Default scrape interval for all endpoints (For example `5s` for 5 seconds, `10m` for 10 minutes) |
| `[[endpoint]]` | `array of inline tables` | An array of inline [table endpoint](#endpoint) configurations |

#### Endpoint

| Item | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| `job-name` | `string` | Job name as defined in Prometheus (needs to be unique) |
| `url` | `string` | URL to the metrics endpoint (can use the shorthand notation) |
| `prometheus-scrape-interval` | `string` | Scrape interval for this endpoint (For example `5s` for 5 seconds, `10m` for 10 minutes) |


See the [CLI reference](/local-development/cli-reference) for more details on the CLI commands and options.
