# Configuring Prometheus

To see your Autometrics-instrumented metrics, you'll need to run [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io). Prometheus is pull-based, meaning it will poll your app on an endpoint you specify to sample the metrics.

## Prometheus locally

Here's how you can setup Prometheus locally:

<Cards num={1}>
	<Card
	children
	icon
	title="Run Prometheus using Autometrics CLI (Recommended)"
	href="/local-development"
	/>
	<Card
	children
	icon
	title="Run Prometheus manually"
	href="/deploying-prometheus/local"
	/>
</Cards>

## Prometheus in production

If you've already tried out Autometrics with Prometheus locally and want to set it up in production, see instructions below for specific deploy targets.
