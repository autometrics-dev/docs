# Deploying Prometheus

Autometrics is built on top of [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) - a popular open source timeseries database and alerting system.

To see the metrics your instrumented app generates you will need to deploy a Prometheus instance alongside it. Prometheus is pull-based, meaning that once deployed it will poll your app on an endpoint you specify to sample the metrics.

## Prometheus locally

To get started and understand how Prometheus works you can run it locally:

<Cards num={1}>
	<Card
	children
	icon
	title="Run Prometheus using Autometrics CLI (Recommended)"
	href="/local-development"
	/>
	<Card
	children
	icon
	title="Run Prometheus manually"
	href="/deploying-prometheus/local"
	/>
</Cards>

## Prometheus in production

If you've already tried out Autometrics with Prometheus locally and want to set it up in production, see instructions below for specific deploy targets.
