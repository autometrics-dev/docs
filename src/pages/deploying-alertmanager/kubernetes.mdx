# Deploying Alertmanager in Kubernetes

Alertmanager is a utility service deployed alongside Prometheus to help route, group, and prioritize alerts. Alertmanager does not trigger alerts - alerting *rules* are set in Prometheus itself, Alertmanager only takes care of the lifecycle of the alert *after* it has been triggered (you can think of it as Zapier but for Prometheus alerts).

Alertmanager is part of the Prometheus stack, the most popular open-source monitoring solution for Kubernetes, therefore deploying and configuring it is pretty straightforward.

## Requirements
- Kubernetes cluster running with `kubectl` configured to access it
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install) installed

### Autometrics-instrumented application with SLOs

Autometrics enables you to set up smarter alerts using the Service Level Objectives (SLO) approach. You can read more about SLOs in Autometrics [here](/slo) and follow the guides for SLO-instrumentation under each supported language:

- [Rust](/rust/adding-alerts-and-slos)
- [TypeScript](/typescript/adding-alerts-and-slos)
- [Go](/go/adding-alerts-and-slos)
- [Python](/python/adding-alerts-and-slos)

## Instructions

<Steps>

### Create a `monitoring` namespace

It is a good practice to keep all monitoring resources in a separate namespace. To create a namespace run the following command (if you already have a namespace for monitoring tools, you can skip this step):

```bash
kubectl create namespace monitoring
```

### Deploy Alertmanager to Kubernetes

Run the following command to install Alertmanager using the Helm chart. If you've already installed Prometheus using Helm, you can skip this step.

```bash
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --namespace monitoring
```

This will install Alertmanager in your cluster along with Prometheus, Node Exporter, and a few other components. As these components are installed together they are configured to work with each other out of the box.

</Steps>

You can now configure your Alertmanager to group, organize, and send alerts to whichever channel you're using for incident response. See [Alertmanager documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/configuration/) for details.
