# Deploying Alertmanager on Docker 

Alertmanager is a utility service deployed alongside Prometheus to help route, group, and prioritize alerts. Alertmanager does not trigger alerts - alerting *rules* are set in Prometheus itself, Alertmanager only takes care of the lifecycle of the alert *after* it has been triggered (you can think of it as Zapier but for Prometheus alerts).

Alertmanager is available as a Docker image from the official Prometheus organization.

## Requirements

### Prometheus

Make sure you have Prometheus running in the environment you're hoping to connect the Alertmanager to. See [Deploying Prometheus to Docker](deploying-prometheus/docker).

### Autometrics-instrumented application with defined SLOs

Autometrics enables you to set up smarter alerts using the Service Level Objectives (SLO) approach. You can read more about SLOs in Autometrics [here](/slo) and follow the guides for SLO-instrumentation under each supported language:

- [Rust](/rust/adding-alerts-and-slos)
- [TypeScript](/typescript/adding-alerts-and-slos)
- [Go](/go/adding-alerts-and-slos)
- [Python](/python/adding-alerts-and-slos)

## Instructions

In the following guide we'll deploy a basic Alertmanager instance configured to work best with Autometrics alerts that will post a notification to Slack whenever there's a breach in the SLO we defined earlier with Autometrics.

<Steps>

### Create a Slack application

First, we need to create a Slack application that will be used to send notifications to Slack. You can create a new Slack application [here](https://api.slack.com/apps). Make sure to install it to the workspace you want to send notifications to.

Once you've created and installed the application, you'll need to get the bot token that will be used to send notifications. You can find it under the `OAuth & Permissions` tab in the application settings.

It will look something like this: `xoxb-*****`.

### Create a configuration file for Alertmanager

Create a file called `alertmanager.yml` with the contents below. 

```yaml filename="alertmanager.yml"
global:
  resolve_timeout: 1m

route:
  receiver: "slack-notifications"

receivers:
  - name: "slack-notifications"
    slack_configs:
      - channel: "#alerts" # replace with whichever Slack channel is used
        send_resolved: true
        api_url: https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage
        http_config:
          authorization:
            credentials: xoxb-my-bot-token
```

The Alertmanager works by defining a set of `receivers` that will be triggered when an alert is triggered. In this case, we're defining a single receiver called `slack-notifications` that will send a notification to Slack.

Alertmanager configuration can be updated at runtime without restarting the service: you can simply update the configuration file `alertmanager.yml` and send a POST request to the `<alertmanager_host>/-/reload` endpoint to reload the configuration.

You can read more about the configuration options available in the [Alertmanager documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/configuration/).

### Run the Docker image

Run the following command to start the Alertmanager Docker image:

```bash
docker run \
    -p 9093:9093 \
    -v $(pwd)/alertmanager.yml:/etc/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml \
    prom/alertmanager:latest
```

This will start the Alertmanager service on port `9093` and mount the configuration file we created earlier.

### Update Prometheus configuration

Now that we have the Alertmanager running, we need to update the Prometheus configuration to point to the Alertmanager instance we just started.

Open the Prometheus configuration file `prometheus.yml` and add the following configuration:

```yaml filename="prometheus.yml"
scrape_configs:
  # ...

alerting:
  alertmanagers:
    - static_configs:
        - targets:
            - "alertmanager:9093" # or the host address of the Alertmanager instance
```
