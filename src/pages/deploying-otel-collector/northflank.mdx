# Deploying OTel Collector on Northflank

<Steps>

### Create a GitHub repository and a Otel Collector configuration file

#### Optional: Export metrics
As the OTel Collector acts as a proxy, we can define an exporter to send metrics. 
In this example, metrics are pushed to [Prometheus's remote write receiver](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#remote-write-receiver). 
Note that while Prometheus advises against this method for efficient sample ingestion, it is chosen here because Autometrics relies on Prometheus for superior querying and visualization capabilities.


### Add a Dockerfile in the root of the repository
The below Dockerfile uses the base Otel Collector image and loads our configuration 

```Dockerfile 
FROM otel/opentelemetry-collector:latest

ADD otel-collector-config.yaml /etc/otelcol/config.yaml
```

### Create a Northflank service from a GitHub repo



### Configure application code
 Utilize the 'push' capabilities in your chosen Autometrics language library, detailed in each language's quickstart section. 
 When initializing the OTLP exporter, specify the endpoint for your deployed OTel Collector. 
 Note that the OTel Collector expects metrics at **/v1/metrics**.
