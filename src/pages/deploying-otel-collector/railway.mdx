# Deploying OTel Collector on Railway
OTel Collector is available as an official [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/otel/opentelemetry-collector) on Docker Hub. We can use it as a base image and layer in our configuration before deploying it on Railway
You find the resources for the Deployment [here](https://github.com/autometrics-dev/autometrics-shared/tree/main/deployment-guides-resources/otel-collector).

<Steps>

### Create a GitHub repository and a Otel Collector configuration file
To set up the OTel Collector instance, utilize Railway's repository deployment and leverage [Dockerfile features](https://docs.railway.app/deploy/dockerfiles). 
Create a file named `otel-collector-config.yaml` to specify a receiver endpoint for sending metrics from the instrumented application

```yaml {filename="otel-collector-config.yml"} showLineNumbers
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318

  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
```
#### Optional: Export metrics
As the OTel Collector acts as a proxy, we can define an exporter to send metrics. 
In this example, metrics are pushed to [Prometheus's remote write receiver](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#remote-write-receiver). 
Note that while Prometheus advises against this method for efficient sample ingestion, it is chosen here because Autometrics relies on Prometheus for superior querying and visualization capabilities.

```yaml {filename="otel-collector-config.yml"} showLineNumbers
exporters:
  prometheusremotewrite:
    endpoint: http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/write
    resource_to_telemetry_conversion:
      enabled: true # Convert resource attributes to

  pipelines:
    metrics:
      exporters: [prometheusremotewrite]
```
You can find the full otel-config.yaml [here](https://github.com/autometrics-dev/autometrics-shared/blob/main/deployment-guides-resources/otel-collector/otel-collector-config.yaml).

### Add a Dockerfile in the root of the repository
The below [Dockerfile](https://github.com/autometrics-dev/autometrics-shared/blob/main/deployment-guides-resources/otel-collector/Dockerfiles) uses the base Otel Collector image and loads our configuration 

```Dockerfile 
FROM otel/opentelemetry-collector:latest

ADD otel-collector-config.yaml /etc/otelcol/config.yaml
```

### Create a Railway service from a GitHub repo
Create a Railway service from our newly created GitHub repo, it should pick up the configuration from the Dockerfile.

### Add a PORT environment variable
In order to make the OTel Collector accessible to other services in your Railway project or externally (optional) - you need to tell Railway which port to listen on using the "magic" PORT environment variable.

To add it go to Service > Variables and add just the port number.
![Railway add PORT variable for Otel Collector](/images/railway-otel-collector-port-variable.png)


### Configure application code
 Utilize the 'push' capabilities in your chosen Autometrics language library, detailed in each language's quickstart section. 
 When initializing the OTLP exporter, specify the endpoint for your deployed OTel Collector. 
 Note that the OTel Collector expects metrics at **/v1/metrics**.
 

 If you have deployed the OTel collector with the port set to 4318 your internal Railway endpoint should look something like this: 

 `http://name-of-collector-service:4318/v1/metrics`
