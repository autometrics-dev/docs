# Configuring Prometheus on Fly.io

Once you have your code instrumented with autometrics, you'll need to run
[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) and point it at your app. Prometheus is
pull-based, meaning it will poll your app to scrape the metrics collected.

[Fly.io](https://fly.io) provides a hosted Prometheus instance for every
project.

To have Fly's Prometheus scrape your autometrics-instrumented app, simply add
this to your fly.toml:

```toml filename="fly.toml"
app = "your-app-name"

[metrics]
port = 9091 # default for most prometheus clients
path = "/metrics" # default for most prometheus clients
```
