# Deploying Explorer on Railway

Explorer can be deployed as a Railway service using the `am-proxy` Docker image. [Railway now supports deployinj the services from Docker images directly](https://railway.app/changelog/2023-09-01-cron-jobs-ui#docker-image-registry-deploys-ga).

<Steps>

### Create a Railway service from a Docker image

Make sure to provide the correct Prometheus URL (can be internal Railway URL) to the `PROMETHEUS_URL` environment variable and kick off the deployment.


### Add a PORT environment variable

In order to make Explorer accessible externally - you need to tell Railway which port to listen on using the "magic" `PORT` environment variable.

### Verify deployment

The Explorer should be accessible at `<RAILWAY_SERVICE_URL>:6789` - navigate there and verify that it has connected with your Prometheus correctly, you should be seeing your Autometrics data come through.
