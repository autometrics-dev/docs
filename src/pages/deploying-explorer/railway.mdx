# Deploying Explorer on Railway

Explorer can be deployed as a Railway service using the `am-proxy` Docker image and a Dockerfile. [Railway will look for a Dockerfile at the service root and include it in the build process](https://docs.railway.app/deploy/dockerfiles).

<Steps>

### Create a GitHub repository with a Dockerfile

Railway enables you to deploy services by adding GitHub repositories.

We can create a minimal repository called e.g.: `your-scope/explorer`, that has just the Dockerfile at the root that Railway will pick up, build, and deploy for us.

```Dockerfile
FROM autometrics/am-proxy:latest

ENV LISTEN_ADDRESS=$LISTEN_ADDRESS
ENV PROMETHEUS_URL=$PROMETHEUS_URL
```

### Create a Railway service from a GitHub repository

Select the previously created `your-scope/explorer` repository. Make sure to provide the correct Prometheus URL (can be internal Railway URL) to the `PROMETHEUS_URL` environment variable (`LISTEN_ADDRESS` is optional) and kick off the deployment.

### Verify deployment

The Explorer should be accessible at `<RAILWAY_URL>:6789` - navigate there and verify that it has connected with your Prometheus correctly, you should be seeing your Autometrics data come through.

</Steps>
