# Deploying Explorer on Docker 
Explorer can be deployed to a Docker container and connected to an existing Prometheus instance as part of the `am` binary using the `am proxy` subcommand.

### Requirements

Make sure you have Prometheus running in the environment you're hoping to connect the Explorer to. See [Deploying Prometheus to Docker](deploying-prometheus/docker).

<Steps>

### Pull the `am-proxy` Docker image
```shell
docker pull autometrics/am-proxy:latest
```

### Run with Docker

Run the below command providing the required arguments as environment variables.

##### Arguments

| Variable | Description|
|----------|------------|
| `PROMETHEUS_URL` | The URL of the Prometheus instance that Explorer should connect to.|

```shell
docker run \
    -e PROMETHEUS_URL="<your_prometheus_url>" \
    autometrics/am-proxy:latest
```

### Verify the setup

Once the image is up and running it will automatically make the Explorer available on port **6789**.
