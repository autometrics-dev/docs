# Deploying Explorer

Explorer is a special Autometrics-specific interface for Prometheus data. It is a simple client-based application that connects to a running Prometheus instance. Once connected it automatically recognizes Autometrics-labeled metrics and visualizes them in a simple and easy to use interface.

## Running Explorer locally

Explorer runs on top of the `am` CLI - simply download, install, and run the CLI and Explorer will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

See [Local Development](/docs/local-development) for more information.

## Deploying Explorer

The `am` CLI can be run as a simple service app and is available as a Docker image. See guides below for platform-specific instructions.
