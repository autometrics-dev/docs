First, we need to create a Slack application that will be used to send notifications to Slack. You can create a new Slack application [here](https://api.slack.com/apps). Make sure to install it to the workspace you want to send notifications to.

Once you've created and installed the application, you'll need to get the bot token that will be used to send notifications. You can find it under the `OAuth & Permissions` tab in the application settings.

It will look something like this: `xoxb-*****`.
